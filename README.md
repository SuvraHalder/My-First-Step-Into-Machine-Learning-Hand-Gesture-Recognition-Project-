# My-First-Step-Into-Machine-Learning-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Project-
🔍 Project Overview: As someone new to machine learning, this project has been an exciting and challenging experience. The goal was to create a system that recognizes hand gestures (A–Z alphabets) using MediaPipe for feature extraction and a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
📌 Key Features:
Custom Dataset Creation: I captured and labeled hand gesture images using OpenCV, building a dataset from scratch.
Feature Extraction: Leveraged MediaPipe to extract 21 hand landmarks for each gesture.
Classification: Trained a Random Forest model to recognize gestures with impressive results.
GUI Development: Built an easy-to-use interface with Tkinter for real-time testing and interaction.
💡 What I Learned:
As a beginner, this project taught me:

The fundamentals of feature extraction and its importance in machine learning.
How algorithms like Random Forest can be used to classify complex patterns.
The excitement of combining code and creativity to solve real-world problems!
🎯 What’s Next?
This is just the start of my machine learning journey! I’m eager to dive deeper into advanced algorithms like CNNs, work on larger datasets, and explore more real-world applications.
